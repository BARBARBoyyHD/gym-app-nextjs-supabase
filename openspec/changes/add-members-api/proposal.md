# Add Members API

## Overview
Implement a complete CRUD API for members that manages gym member information. This API will handle member registration, profile management, and member-related data operations within the system.

## Motivation
The system needs a way to manage gym members with their personal information, profiles, and other member-specific data. This is essential for the core functionality of the gym management system, allowing for member check-ins, membership tracking, and other member-related operations.

## Scope
- Create API endpoints for members following the standardized directory structure
- Implement GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations for members
- Ensure proper handler usage to maintain consistency with other API endpoints
- Define proper TypeScript types for member entities

## Out of Scope
- Frontend interface for managing members
- Authentication and authorization for members (separate system)
- Payment processing
- Detailed member activity tracking (separate APIs)
