# Dashboard Layout

## Why
The current gym management application lacks a centralized dashboard that provides an overview of important business metrics. Admin users need a single place to view key data points such as member counts, membership statuses, payment information, and other vital statistics to make informed decisions. This change will create a comprehensive dashboard layout that displays important data and metrics for gym management.

## What Changes
- Create a dashboard page component that displays key metrics
- Implement metric cards for member count, active memberships, revenue, and recent activity
- Integrate with existing data fetching patterns
- Ensure responsive design that works across devices
- Maintain consistency with existing design system

## Impact
- New capability: Dashboard overview page
- User experience: Admins get centralized view of key metrics
- Affected specs: navigation integration
- Affected code: New dashboard component, potential updates to navigation
